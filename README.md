# BizTalk Pipeline Components Extensions Utility Pack
BizTalk Pipeline Components Extensions Utility Pack is a set of custom pipeline components (libraries) with several custom pipeline components that can be used in received and sent pipelines, which will provide an extension of BizTalk out-of-the-box pipeline capabilities.

## Content-Based Routing
### CBRIdocOperationPromotionEncode

* Content Based Routing Component to promote IDOC Operation property.
  * This component requires one configuration that is the MessageType string to be ignored. Then it will take the last string (word) from the MessageType Message Context Property and promote it to the Operation Message Context Property.

### CBROperationPromotionEncode

* Content Based Routing Component to promote Operation property.
  * This component doesn't requires any configuration. Then it will take the value (word) which lies ahead of the cardinal (#) from the MessageType message context property and promote it to the Operation Message Context Property.
  
  
## Compression
### Multi-Part Message Attachments Zipper Pipeline Component

* The BizTalk Multi-Part Message Attachments Zipper is a pipeline component for BizTalk Server which can be used in a send pipeline and is intended to replace all attachments of a multi-part message for its zipped equivalent.
* The capabilities are similar to those available in compression software such as WinZip or 7-zip:
  * Attachments Compression â€“ Extracts, in a send pipeline, all message parts include in a multi-part message that are not included in the message body (Message Body Part = False), compresses it and attaches the compressed attachment back to the message..
  * This component requires one configuration that is the FileExtension where you can specified if you want for example a .zip or .gz file.

## Deploying Pipeline Components
All the .NET pipeline component assemblies (native and custom) must be located in the <installation directory>\Pipeline Components folder to be executed by the server. If the pipeline with a custom component will be deployed across several servers, the component's binaries must be present in the specified folder on every server.

You do not need to add a custom pipeline component to be used by the BizTalk Runtime to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).
