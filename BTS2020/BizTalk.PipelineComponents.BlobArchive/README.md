# Azure Blob Storage Archive Pipeline Component
The Azure Blob Storage Archive Pipeline Component is, as the name suggests, a component that enables you to archive incoming/outgoing messages from any adapters to an Azure Blog Storage account.Â 

This is the list of properties that you can set up on the archive pipeline component:

| Property Name  | Description  | Sample Values |
| -------------  | -----------  | ------------- |
| ContainerName  | Blob Container Name | biztalk-app-storage  |
| StorageAccntConnection | ConnectionString to the Storage Account | DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<storage-account-name>;AccountKey=<account-key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net |

Of course, to be able to use it we need to create a Storage Account in our Azure Subscription.

THIS PIPELINE COMPONENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
